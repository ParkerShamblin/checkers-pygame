## Motivation
I decided to create checkers in Python using Pygame to help increase my knowledge of Python and Object Oriented Programming. I've uploaded a Youtube video of the project conclusion [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZKtqoxEmBU), where I talk about what I learned from the project and how I felt about the project after completing it.

This the first programming project I have ever completed entirely on my own and I must admit that it was much more challenging than the "follow along tutorial projects" that I'm used to. However, I found this checkers project to be considerably more productive in furthering my knowledge of python and object oriented programming. Being forced to create my own solutions to problems I encountered really helped engrained valuable concepts into my head.
