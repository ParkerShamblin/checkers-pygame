# Summary
Play checkers with your friend on a local computer. Simply download the project and run the "checkers.py" file to play. Warning: I wrote this when I first learned how to program in Python, so this project is complete spaghetti code.

### Requirements
- python 3+
- pygame 1.9.5

### How to play 
Simply download the project and run the "checkers.py" file.
